However this does not appear to be a huge loss as we would not expect a person's name to be a factor in whether they are a poi or not (and in real life if fed into a machine learning algorithm this may actually be \"overfitting\" data as it may be \"looking up\" the answer from other sources). Also email adresses do not specify rank which may have information value.\n",

In total, we have removed 60 persons from our 146 person sample and 4 of them being POIs. Initially, POIs were 12.3% of our sample, now they are 16.3% of our sample. It is usueful to keep this in mind when considering whether we are happy with the algorithm that we have built. In this case, we would need to investigate why there are people with no emails - it is likely that the records are incomplete - therefore we would not want the algorithm to use the lack of an emails as a flag as to whether the person is or isn't a POI."

In previous plots using total email counts, the fact that people in different positions have differing email requirements and so the plots are being distorted by absolute numbers, converting to ratios is definitely improving our signal.

ani spread option valu or multipl valu base on 90 degre output i may be wrong but it is also my recollect that this is a warranti issu rather than a true output issu ie we could increas the mws at ani

hard dollar out of westinghous rather than an increas in output which will onli be guarante for a limit amount of time and like will not be paid for by a buyer the thought process on the eecc side is for them to find overhead and cost save to fund their fee 90m rather than further increas to the capit cost of the facil as well given current account languag ani fee we pay will have to be expens to

impact of oper at reduc capac privileg and confidenti our memorandum of today date on the dqe facil estim a 65 to 70 likelihood of the facil qualifi for section 29 tax credit base on project volum of 225 ton per hour as we discuss a week ago if we oper the facil at a volum of 118 per hour ie halfcapac we believ we would allevi the tax risk associ with the increas in capac the question is doe that improv in the odd with respect to that one issu improv the bottomlin odd on qualif at least with respect to the base volum of 118 per hour from the 65 to 70 estim that we specifi in our memorandum we think it doe but we are not sure that there will be a materi improv we have pass that question on to our outsid tax counsel and will let you know his view as we note last week there are sever legal issu for which while we think we have the better argument there is no definit legal preced even pull the capac issu out of the equat which is what we would be do if we are onli consid the 118 ton there are still sever other ball in the air and we would have to catch each and everi one in order to have a taxcreditworthi facil when you look at each issu separ it seem possibl to get comfort as to each one but when you consid that there are sever such issu and that we have to be right each and everi time you have to lower your overal odd statist speak if you are 80 comfort as to each of 5 separ issu then you would expect to hit on 4 out of 5 not on 5 out of 5 but we cant lose on ani one issu and still qualifi for credit obtain a privat letter rule from the ir as to these issu which is our ultim goal would take these issu out of the air so to speak but that not go to happen preclos and no matter what assur we might get at a prerul confer with the ir unless and until you actual get the rule there is an element of risk that you have to assum for that reason the 90 probabl number that i threw out at last week meet in respons to a question about what our comfort level would be if we had a privat letter rule is realli a red herring becaus at decis time there not go to be a rule in hand as note abov i will let you know what bruce lemon view is sinc he is the one who will be call upon to give an opinion hope that will be later today kevin liss x58601', u'ddelainnsf guy let set up a meet between the three of us on monday asap to discuss i have a few idea and i probabl need to

want to consid get out with keyspan and peopl togeth in a more social set sometim in march mayb the master would work i think keyspan has the abil to get out of the coral relationship earli if they realli want to it current goe through april 2002 although i think it will probabl take the better part of next year to formul the entir structur around this jv i think the potenti is to have a

involv his knowledg of that market and compani and his relationship with devario anderson fazio the oper folk etc is extrem good if you decid that you do not want to have gil involv in this not a good decis you need to move him out of his current role given the fact that we are use the peopl jv as a showcas laura luce can be veri close connect to gil and keyspan in a veri natur and genuin way gil will need to lean on laura expertis in how she set up the chicago jv throughout the process i plan to insert michael brown into the deal team to focus on the power and fuel oil compon michael has excel relationship with all the folk at keyspan and his knowledg of keyspan power portfolio and that power market will be critic ed mcmichael will lead all the structur effort gas and mayb power too

calpin pastoria earli in the week calpin claw back about 12 million from their bid primarili by claim that the turbin contract is overpr by 10 million and their bid assum market for the turbin while they are correct the extra 10 million for catalytica we have gotten most of that back there bid now is 37mm vs 41 plus up to 5mm if the conting is not use between sign and close calpin also want to includ other permit other than cec as condit preced and they want us to rep that the schedul permit are the onli one requir to construct and oper this is far too oner and we are push back on this our plan is to get a psa that onli has hsr and cec permit as condit preced the other negoti item is with respect to mechan of continu the develop between sign and close and who pay for it and who is at risk this is relev if you think of the scenario where increment cost are necessari in order to get the nonappeal cec permit ae pastoria same psa issu as abov but ae seem more skiddish about the

flaw in the past two year five plant were approv and onli one was appeal this was due to a resid that was not notifi and therefor the project broke the law this caus a 4 month delay the two bidder will not take the risk on the cec permit get appeal in calpin word it would look pretti bad on wall street if they had to write off a 40mm develop fee paid to enron for noth aesla vega they seem genuin interest in the asset more the expans than the qf they like lm6000s and think they are great resourc for the locat we told them they are behind the other bidder both on time and valu they have review the epc contract and understand the qualiti of the lds liabil limit and the consortium epc group they indic that they have no problem with get increment insur in order to protect the valu of hit june 2002 they want to meet with the epc group and provid input to the notic to proceed close for them on this deal is a littl cleaner than pastoria becaus we have the permit in hand and it is not

progress last week on the sale of pastoria and las vega kelemen is do a great job in general calpin is more agress and can move quicker than ae ae has one small team on both deal and is slower at turn doc without give up ani right or discourag ae from pursu pastoria we are tri to posit ae on lv and keep calpin valu for pastoria close to their origin bid calpin pastoria earli in the week calpin claw back about 12 million from their bid primarili by claim that the turbin contract is overpr by 10 million and their bid assum market for the turbin while they are correct the extra 10 million for catalytica we have gotten most of that back there bid now is 37mm vs 41 plus up to 5mm if the conting is not use between sign and close calpin also want to includ other permit other than cec as condit preced and they want us to rep that the schedul permit are the onli one requir to construct and oper this is far too oner and we are push back on this our plan is to get a psa that onli has hsr and cec permit as condit preced the other negoti item is with respect to mechan of continu the develop between sign and close and who pay for it and who is at risk this is relev if you think of the scenario where increment cost are necessari in order to get the nonappeal cec permit ae pastoria same psa issu as abov but ae seem more skiddish about the develop risk other than cec they want to chang some of the epc contract term they want a moreinvolv transit team and they want us to take more risk on postsigningpreclos develop their bid was 27million plus upsid for the 250mw expans and a servic agreement for fuel suppli and schedul coordin servic we have given them term sheet that provid for an extra 10 million for the 250mw expans and approxim 750000 per year of riskfre servic revenu they have not yet respond by contrast calpin doe not want to use nepco and they dont want our servic or ani materi ongo involv cleaner cec process on thursday night we receiv the presid member propos decis pmpd recommend approv of the project by statut this is one month earli and the quickest in california to date this is a 400 page document and we are comb through it to determin ani materi chang from our origin file and the origin staff assess none detect yet the state process is that we would receiv our cec permit on decemb 20 after which their is a 30 day appeal period if there is no appeal the process is done jan 19 for purpos of handicap the risk we have alreadi gone through the public hear process while there was some intervent our remot site is not in the environmentalnimbi crosshair like other project in order for the appeal process to derail the time someon need to show that i a law was broken or ii the cec analysi is serious flaw in the past two year five plant were approv and onli one was appeal this was due to a resid that was not notifi and therefor the project broke the law this caus a 4 month delay the two bidder will not take the risk on the cec permit get appeal in calpin word it would look pretti bad on wall street if they had to write off a 40mm develop fee paid to enron for noth aesla vega they seem genuin interest in the asset more the expans than the qf they like lm6000s and think they are great resourc for the locat we told them they are behind the other bidder both on time and valu they have review the epc contract and understand the qualiti of the lds liabil limit and the consortium epc group they indic that they have no problem with get increment insur in order to protect the valu of hit june 2002 they want to meet with the epc group and provid input to the notic to proceed close for them on this deal is a littl cleaner than pastoria becaus we have the permit in hand and it is not as big a bet smaller asset exist oper less polit risk etc our plan is to turn the psa one more time monday and then tell them that if they get their bid up a few million 26mm to say 30mm we will focus on them for a week or so to tri to get it close deal time pastoria firm up calpin on valu and risk alloc dure the next week and aim for sign and hsr file on decemb 1 sometim befor decemb 1 we need to final our plan with respect to earn recognit we have been talk with deffner westfal and lawyer about differ structur involv either i ljm ii aig or iii sell to calpin with liquid damag relat to cec permit as you can imagin there are pros and con to each approach we expect to know more on this by wednesday of this week and will updat you at that time deal time las vega the onli condit preced should be the hsr if they can move quicker we will target decemb 1 to sign and late dec to close the urgenc relat to schedul the longer we wait the greater the risk of miss june 2002 cod with respect to qiv earn ae bid result in a 6mm hit sign the deal to sell reduc fair market valuat two possibl we are explor if ae increas it bid the hit may be neglib altern we may be abl to discount the lm6000s be sold to them which may not show up as a hit sinc the

the increas mws given well known industri issu with the 501f technolog further ani buyer will pay base upon 90 degre output which is the same in ani case ie increas output onli help when ambient temperatur are lower than 90 degre at site like the buyer will run ani spread option valu or multipl valu base on 90 degre output i may be wrong but it is also my recollect that this is a warranti issu rather than a true output issu ie we could increas the mws at ani time but we would like run into warranti issu with westinghous given that the warranti expir in less than twelv month what valu do we realli get would it not be better to get the maximum amount of hard dollar out of westinghous rather than an increas in output which will onli be guarante for a limit amount of time and like will not be paid for by a buyer the thought process on the eecc side is for them to find overhead and cost save to fund their fee 90m rather than further increas to the capit cost of the facil as well given current account languag ani fee we pay will have to be expens to current earn rather than capit so i would like to find way for this to be self financ my knowledg on this one is rather cursori

improv in the odd with respect to that one issu improv the bottomlin odd on qualif at least with respect to the base volum of 118 per hour from the 65 to 70 estim that we specifi in our memorandum we think it doe but we are not sure that there will be a materi improv we have pass that question on to our outsid tax counsel and will let you know his view as we note last week there are sever legal issu for which while we think we have the better argument there is no definit legal preced even pull the capac issu out of the equat which is what we would be do if we are onli consid the 118 ton there are still sever other ball in the air and we would have to catch each and everi one in order to have a taxcreditworthi facil when you look at each issu separ it seem possibl to get comfort as to each one but when you consid that there are sever such issu and that we have to be right each and everi time you have to lower your overal odd statist speak if you are 80 comfort as to each of 5 separ issu then you would expect to hit on 4 out of 5 not on 5 out of 5 but we cant lose on ani one issu and still qualifi for credit obtain a privat letter rule from the ir as to these issu which is our ultim goal would take these issu out of the air so to speak but that not go to happen preclos and no matter what assur we might get at a prerul confer with the ir unless and until you actual get the rule there is an element of risk that you have to assum for that reason the 90 probabl number that i threw out at last week meet in respons to a question about what our comfort level would be if we

the grid are enorm infinit more so than build new plant for exampl the averag lead time to permit not built just permit a highvoltag power line is 57 year as a result a medium size line 345kv 200 mile can cost upward of 12 billion that was the most frustrat part of the 18 month i chase this stuff while the basic solut appear to be so logic the busi the util regulatori and environment regim are so backward in their think that break in was basic imposs unless were will to put a billion at risk for 57 year on a merchant basi not hell you cant even get 100 million for your refineri deal solv the power suppli shortag is onli part of the equat and your coal idea is legitim as new technolog can burn coal almost as clean as gas but until the ferc and state puc forc the issu of expand the grid to becom a more fungibl and integr transmiss system the util will continu to oper in their vacuum as these transmiss barrier are the onli thing protect their turf even though some have given the appear

make sens to build a state of the art coal power plant closer to the actual coal suppli wherebi we avoid the ever increas transport cost and then suppli power by wire to surround state state rich in

the way gas doe and the impedi to expand the grid are enorm infinit more so than build new plant for exampl the averag lead time to permit not built just permit a highvoltag power line is 57 year as a result a medium size line 345kv 200 mile can cost upward of 12 billion that was the most frustrat part of the 18 month i chase this stuff while the basic solut appear to be so logic the busi the util regulatori and environment regim are so backward in their think that break in was basic imposs unless were will to put a billion at risk for 57 year on a merchant basi not hell you cant even get 100

like chuck is veri interest in pursu this jv that would focus on optim keyspan gas power and fuel oil portfolio chuck is now plan to come to houston in midjanuari to sit down with us and further these

next year to formul the entir structur around this jv i think the potenti is to have a commerci structur in place and effect go into next winter or coincid with the termin of the keyspancor

credit from the buyer for the increas mws given well known industri issu with the 501f technolog further ani buyer will pay base upon 90 degre output which is the same in ani case ie increas output onli help when ambient temperatur are lower than 90 degre at site like the buyer will run ani spread option valu or multipl valu base on 90 degre output i may be wrong but it is also my recollect that this is a warranti issu rather than a true output issu ie we could increas the mws at ani time but we would like run into warranti issu with westinghous given that the warranti expir in less than twelv month what valu do we realli get would it not be better to get the maximum amount of hard dollar out of westinghous rather than an increas in output which will onli be guarante for a limit amount of time and like will not be paid for by a buyer the thought process on the eecc side is for them to find overhead and cost save to fund their fee 90m rather than further increas to the capit cost of the facil as well given current account languag ani fee we pay will have to be expens to current earn rather than capit so i would like to find way for this to be self financ my knowledg on

right or discourag ae from pursu pastoria we are tri to posit ae on lv and keep calpin valu for pastoria close to their origin bid calpin pastoria earli in the week calpin claw back about 12 million from their bid primarili by claim that the turbin contract is overpr by 10 million and their bid assum market for the turbin while they are correct the extra 10 million for catalytica we have gotten most of that back there bid now is 37mm vs 41 plus up to 5mm if the conting is not use between sign and close calpin also want to includ other permit other than cec as condit preced and they want us to rep that the schedul permit are the onli one requir to construct and oper this is far too oner and we are push back on this our plan is to get a psa that onli has hsr and cec permit as condit preced the other negoti item is with respect to mechan of continu the develop between sign and close and who pay for it and who is at risk this is relev if you think of the scenario where increment cost are necessari in order to get the nonappeal cec permit ae pastoria same psa issu as abov but ae seem more skiddish about the develop risk other than cec they want to chang some of the epc contract term they want a moreinvolv transit team and they want us to take more risk on postsigningpreclos develop their bid was 27million plus upsid for the 250mw expans and a servic agreement for

like other project in order for the appeal process to derail the time someon need to show that i a law was broken or ii the cec analysi is serious flaw in the past two year five plant were approv and onli one was appeal this was due to a resid that was not notifi and therefor the project broke the law this caus a 4 month delay the two bidder will not take the risk on the cec permit get appeal in calpin word it would look pretti bad on wall street if they had to write off a 40mm develop fee paid to enron for noth aesla vega they seem genuin interest in the asset more the expans than the qf they like lm6000s and think they are great resourc for the locat we told them they are behind the other bidder both on time and valu they have review the epc contract and understand the qualiti of the

burn in a combust turbin much like natur gas in it gaseous form coal can be clean of mani of it pollutantform impur such as sulfur dioxid nitrogen oxid and particul matter goodman said the key to the technolog is the abil to burn the coal gas in a high effici gas turbin rather than burn it to make steam to turn a turbin he ad the new technolog can produc 100 megawatt of power with twothird less coal than a tradit boilertyp coal generat said goodman and higher natur gas price could move this technolog closer to a realiti the urgenc of get on with this coal technolog is the forecast for gas price said goodman at 250mmbtu it a bigger stretch for this coal plant to compet with gas than at 300 or 350mmbtu new coal technolog may also address emiss goodman said southern hope to make a decis

doc without give up ani right or discourag ae from pursu pastoria we are tri to posit ae on lv and keep calpin valu for pastoria close to their origin bid calpin pastoria earli in the week calpin claw back about 12 million from their bid primarili by claim that the turbin contract is overpr by 10 million and their bid assum market for the turbin while they are correct the extra 10 million for catalytica we have gotten most of that back there bid now is 37mm vs 41 plus up to 5mm if the conting is not use between sign and close calpin also want to includ other permit other than cec as condit preced and they want us to rep that the schedul permit are the onli one requir to construct and oper this is far too oner and we are push back on this our plan is to get a psa that onli has hsr and cec permit as condit preced the other negoti item is with respect to mechan of continu the develop between sign and close and who pay for it and who is at risk this is relev if you think of the scenario where increment cost are necessari in order to get the nonappeal cec permit ae pastoria same psa issu as abov but ae seem more skiddish about the develop risk other than cec they want to

like other project in order for the appeal process to derail the time someon need to show that i a law was broken or ii the cec analysi is serious flaw in the past two year five plant were approv and onli one was appeal this was due to a resid that was not notifi and therefor the project broke the law this caus a 4 month delay the two bidder will not take the risk on the cec permit get appeal in calpin word it would look pretti bad on wall street if they had to write off a 40mm develop fee paid to enron for noth aesla vega they seem genuin interest in the asset more the expans than the qf
